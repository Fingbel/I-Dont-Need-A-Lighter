title=I Don't Need A Lighter
description=[h2] What is this mod ? [/h2]
description=[noparse] So you're telling me that people can't light a cigarette while sitting in front of a campfire or while driving around in a 90's car ? Well this is over with this mod. You now have access to a car-lighter within every car and you can also light a cigarette on any kitchen stove or similar source of flame ![/noparse]
