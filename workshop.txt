description=[h2]Philosophy behind this mod[/h2]
description=The first iteration of this mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2714198296] I Don't Need A Lighter[/url] missed the balance I was aiming at. It made the Smoker trait even more a freebie point than it should. With this version I want to keep the vanilla's lighters as the best option to light a cigarette, but also provide the player more risky and/or scarce alternate options .

description=[h2]Planned feature[/h2]
description=[list]
description=[*] Sandbox options to adjust the percentage of chance to spawn a car lighter in each vehicle
description=[*] All stove smoking methods are gonna be more risky (injury / break the cigarette / induce stress on failure/etc). The chance of failure will be calculated from the current state of the player (moodles & stats) + what appliance is currently being used + a random factor (sandbox option)
